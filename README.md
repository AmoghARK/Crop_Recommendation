# Crop_Recommendationcd
This project aids farmers in selecting optimal crops by analyzing environmental and soil conditions through Machine Learning. It considers factors like temperature, rainfall, humidity, soil type, and nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium). Built in Jupyter Notebook, it uses Random Forest and Decision Trees for accurate crop predictions.
